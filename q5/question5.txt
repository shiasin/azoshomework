  system()  executes a command specified in string by calling /bin/sh -c string, and returns
       after the command has been completed.  During execution of the command,  SIGCHLD  will  be
       blocked, and SIGINT and SIGQUIT will be ignored.


and return values:

 The  value returned is 127 if the execve() call for /bin/sh fails, -1 if there was another
       error and the return code of the command otherwise.

       If the value of string is NULL, system() returns nonzero if the shell  is  available,  and
       zero if not.

       system() does not affect the wait status of any other children.

code:
        #include <stdlib.h>

       int system (const char * string);
